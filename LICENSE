Thepigcat’s anti-drama license

This open-source license gives you permission to use the source code, fork this project and
modify it for contribution to the main project or private use. But it prevents
you from redistributing the project without making incremental changes to the source code. 
When doing so, you must also use the same license and credit the original author(s).

You are not allowed to use any art without explicit permission from the team either.
